     * The **ImmutabilityProvider** object,
     * being attached to a {@link wijmo.grid.FlexGrid} control,
     * allows the latter to perform data edits without mutating the underlying
     * data. Instead, this class provides a data change event, which can be used to dispatch
     * change actions to the global _Store_, such as a
     * <a href="https://redux.js.org/" target="_blank">Redux</a> _Store_.
     *
     * In framework interops, this class is usually represented by a framework specific
     * component, like a {@link wijmo.react.grid.immutable.ImmutabilityProvider} component
     * for <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a>,
     * which is more convenient to use in the context of the framework.
     *
     * The controlled **FlexGrid** control should not specify its **itemsSource**. Instead, the
     * **itemsSource** property of this class instance should be assigned with the
     * immutable array from the _Store_, which grid will display and edit.
     *
     * When a user edits data via the datagrid,
     * the {@link wijmo.grid.immutable.ImmutabilityProvider.dataChanged} event is triggered,
     * bringing all the necessary information to you about the change (which item is affected,
     * if item was changed or added or deleted, and so on). This event should be used to dispatch
     * corresponding data change actions to the _Store_.
     *
     * Note that **FlexGrid** edits data on a row level basis, which means that you can change multiple
     * cell values in the same row, and only after you move focus out of the row, all the changes
     * to the row will be applied simultaneously. Or you can press the _Cancel_ key to cancel all
     * the changes in the row. The same is true for adding a row into the datagrid.
     *
     * Note also that some changes like pasting a text into the datagrid, or deleting rows,
     * can affect multiple rows. In this case **ImmutabilityProvider** will trigger
     * the {@link ImmutabilityProvider.dataChanged} event
     * multiple times, separately for each affected row. This simplifies data change processing
     * in the _Store_ reducers.
     *
     * This example demonstrates a fully editable **FlexGrid** component, with an associated
     * **ImmutabilityProvider** component bound to an array from the _Redux Store_. The dataChanged
     * event handler dispatches corresponding data change actions to the _Store_.
     * ```typescript
     *   import { ImmutabilityProvider, DataChangeEventArgs, DataChangeAction } from '@grapecity/wijmo.grid.immutable';
     *   import { FlexGrid } from '@grapecity/wijmo.grid';
     *   import { store } from './store';
     *   import { addItemAction, removeItemAction, changeItemAction } from './actions';
     *
     *   const grid = new FlexGrid('#grid', {
     *       allowAddNew: true,
     *       allowDelete: true
     *   });
     *   const provider = new ImmutabilityProvider(grid, {
     *       itemsSource: store.getState().items,
     *       dataChanged: (s: ImmutabilityProvider, e: DataChangeEventArgs) => {
     *          switch (e.action) {
     *               case DataChangeAction.Add:
     *                   store.dispatch(addItemAction(e.newItem));
     *                 break;
     *               case DataChangeAction.Remove:
     *                   store.dispatch(removeItemAction(e.newItem, e.itemIndex));
     *                   break;

     *          }
