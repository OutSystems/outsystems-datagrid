# Data Grid for Reactive [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache--2.0-blue.svg)](https://github.com/OutSystems/outsystems-datagrid-reactive-new/blob/master/LICENSE) ![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg) 
View, explore, and edit large amounts of data in a familiar spreadsheet interface with the Data Grid component for **OutSystems Reactive Web apps**.

## About the component
The goal for the Data Grid Reactive component is to help you develop applications that need data visualization and manipulation features that are not currently covered by other components.

Use the Data Grid to create enterprise-grade interfaces that are more suitable and time-effective than designing a custom solution every time you need to manipulate dense datasets.  

#### Key features 
* Built for Reactive Web apps 
* Data selection and editing in a familiar interface 
* Data sorting by parameter 
* Data grouping 
* Virtual Scrolling

The code is written in TypeScriptðŸ–¤, and you branch it and PR your changes/proposals!

### What tools should you use?
We highly recommend the usage of the following tools:
* [Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* With these extensions:
  * Document This
  * ESLint
  * Prettier - Code formatter

### How to use change this code?
1. Create a branch based in the branch **master** (lastest & greatest release)
2. Open your Visual Code in your branch
3. Run the following command in Visual Code terminal: `npm install` (this will install all the dependencies that you need)
4. Do your magic! :)
5. **Document your code** (with the extension "Document This", start typing `/**` and the extension will give you a good starting point
6. Compile and fix errors and warnings (in Visual Code terminal: `npm run build`)
