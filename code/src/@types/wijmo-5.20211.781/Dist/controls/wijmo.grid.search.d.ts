     * The {@link FlexGridSearch} control allows users to quickly search the
     * items displayed in a {@link FlexGrid}.
     *
     * The control filters the items and shows only the ones that contain
     * the text provided by the user. It also highlights the matches in
     * the target {@link FlexGrid} (except for templated cells, which do
     * not support highlighting).
     *
     * The {@link FlexGridSearch} control may be used in conjunction with
     * the {@link FlexGridFilter} control, which provides column-specific
     * filtering.
     *
     * The example below shows how you can create a {@link FlexGridSearch}
     * control and connect it to a {@link FlexGrid}:
     * ```typescript
     * import { FlexGrid } from '@grapecity/wijmo.grid';
     * import { FlexGridSearch } from '@grapecity/wijmo.grid.search';
     *
     * // create FlexGrid
     * let grid = new FlexGrid('#gridElement', {
     *     itemsSource: getData();
     * });
     *
     * // create FlexGridSearch and connect it to the grid
     * let search = new FlexGridSearch('#searchElement', {
     *     grid: grid
     * });
     * ```
